Use \TZPcommonlisp (which user must set) to decide whether to wrap CL-

The file produced by running TeX on a document that uses eval4tex.tex now
contains Scheme code that can be directly loaded into Scheme (that need not
have tex2page procedures loaded also).  

Read | as escape (i.e., with catcode 0) within \eval's argument.  This
allows user to put arguments fashioned from outside into the Scheme code. 

Separated out eval4tex.tex and picscheme.tex and related doc from the
tex2page distribution, as these can be used without tex2page.  For previous
history of eval4tex and picscheme, see the tex2page history file for the
dates:
